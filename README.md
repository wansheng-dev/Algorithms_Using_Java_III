Singly Linked List Algorithm Using Java - 20200206

Objectives:
	● Practice creating classes and objects.
	● Learn and implement a singly linked list in Java.

Tasks:
	● Create a Node class like the above.
	● Fill in the constructor method that sets the value to a given number and next to null of your Node objects.
	● Create a SinglyLinkedList class like the above.
	● Create a constructor method that sets the head to null of your SinglyLinkedList objects
	● Create a remove() method that will remove a node from the end of your list
	● Create printValues() method that will print all the values of each node in the list in order
	● Create a ListTester class like the above.

Optional Challenges:
	● Implement a find(int) method that will return the first node with the value in the parameter
	● Implement a removeAt(int) method that will remove the node after n nodes, where n is the parameter. For example, if n is 0, remove the first node. If n is 1, remove the second node. Similar to Arrays.
